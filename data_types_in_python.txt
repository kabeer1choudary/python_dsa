Data types - Object and Mutability

Everything is object in python

Object have 3 properties [identity, type, value]

Each Object can be Mutable(changable) or Immutable(non-changable) based on identity

Identity is a reference of a data type in memory.

Numbers: (Immutable)
    - Integers
    - Boolean
    - Real Numbers (floats/decimal)
    - Complex Numbers

String: (Immutable)
    - Indexing
    - Slicing

Tuples: (Immutable)
    - Packing and Unpacking
    - Membership

Lists: (Mutable)
    - Append (at the end)
    - Remove
    - Extend (another list)
    - Insert (on certain index)
    - Pop (at the end)
    - Reverse
    - Sort
    - Max / Min functions: max(list), min(list)
    - Operator overloading: list1 + list2, list * 2
    - Bytearray

Sets & Frozensets: (Unique)
    - Union (Set A | Set B)
    - Intersection (Set A & Set B)
    - Difference (Set A - Set B)
    - Membership test ( {'item' in Set A} )
