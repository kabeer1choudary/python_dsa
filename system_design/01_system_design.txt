What is system design ?
    - process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces and data flow for a system to meet specific requirements
    - involves high-level decisions about scalbility, reliability, performance and maintainability
    - used in real world applications, web apps, distributed systems, databases and cloud interfaces

Why system design is important ?
    - scalbility & reliability
    - architectural thinking
    - career growth
    - real world problem solving
    - trade-offs & decision making
    - future proofing
