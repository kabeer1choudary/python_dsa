A) Networking & Communication - Networking is the foundation of system design
- Why networking matters
    * data exchange between components
    * enables scalbility, reliability & performance
    * communication - load balancing - security - efficiency

- How networking impacts Large scale systems
    * handles many users concurrently
    * efficient data exchange
    * reduces latency & improves resilience
    * essential for cloud & distributed systems

- Intro to IP Address
    * unique numerical labels assigned to devices in n/w
    * enables communication between different machines and services across internet
    * 2 versions - IPv4, IPv6
    * 2 categories - private, public
    * IPv4 - 32bit address - 4.3 billion
    * IPv6 - 128bit address - 340 undecillion
    * private ip - local n/w - cannot access internet directly
    * public ip - assigned by ISP - communicate over internet
    * need of private ips - IPV4 limitation - security - NAT (allow multiple devices to share single public ip)
    * role of ips - scalbility - security - load balancing - cloud networking - microservices & containers

- How DNS Works
    * translates human readable domain names into ip addresses
    * Types of DNS
        - Root Name Servers : top level servers handling .com, .org, .net etc.
        - TLD Name Servers : Top Level Domain NS, specific to domains
        - Authoritative NS : stores domain-specific records
        - Recursive Resolvers : handle queries on behalf od users, contains multiple DNS servers
    * DNS caching - reduces latency & load on DNS servers - caching happens in browser, OS, Recursive Resolvers - TTL (time-to-live) determines how long a cached record is valid
    * DNS process
        browser > OS > local DNS > root DNS > TLD NS > Authoritative NS > ip return to browser
    * DNS in large scale systems
        - ensures HA (using load balancing or anycast DNS)
        - failover strategies using primary & secondary servers
        - optimize CDNs performance
        - security risks (DNS poisoning, cache poisoning, DDoS attacks)

- Client - Server Model
    * client request services, servers provide them
    * foundation of web, db and app architecture
    * efficient resource management
    * Key components
        - Client : user facing app that sends requests
        - Server : system that process the requests and returns response
        - Network : medium that facilitates communication between client and server
    * Types of communication - request/response model (http), persistent connections, synchronous/asynchronous communication
    * Types of servers
        - stateful servers : maintain session info across requests - personalize - seamless user experiences
        - stateless servers : no memory of past session interactions, each request is independant, scalable - easy cache - loadbalanced
        
- Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy
    * proxy is an intermediary server between client and server - helps with security, caching, traffic control and anonymity
    * forward proxy - sits infront of the client - privacy, anonymity, content filtering, bypass geo-restrictions, caching
    * reverse proxy - sits between users and backend servers - load balancing, security & DDoS protection, SSL termination, caching & compression
    * forward proxy helps client interactions with internet securely
    * reverse proxy protects and optimizes backend servers

- Load Balancers
    * high availability - traffic distribution - prevents overload - handles failures gracefully - supports scalbility
    * Types of Load Balancers
        - Based on Layer : Layer 4 (Transport Layer - TCP/UDP), Layer 7 (Application Layer - HTTP/HTTPS)
        - Based on Deployment - Hardware LB, Software LB, Cloud based LB
    * LB strategies
        - Static Load Balancing : Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hashing
        - Dynamic Load Balancing : Least Response time, Adaptive load balancing, Weighted load balancing

- API Gateways
    * APIs connect clients to backend services - exposing backend services lead to performance, security and management challanges
    * API Gateway is a centralized entry point for all API requests, handling authentication, routing, caching and security
    * API Gateway acts as reverse proxy between clients and backend services - receives API requests, process them and forward to correct services
    * Key functions of API Gateway - request transformation, authentication, rate limiting and response handling
    * Benefits of API Gateway - security, rate limiting, load balancing, caching, request trasformation, logging & monitoring
    * Security features of API Gateway - authentication & authorization, DDoS protection, Bot protection, TLS termination, rate limiting, throttling
    * Caching speeds up API responses by storing frequently accessed data
    * Types of Caching - in-memory caching, response caching, edge caching
    * API composition & aggregation - API Gateways combine multiple API calls into single request, useful for microservices architecture

- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
    * CDN - globally distributed network of servers that work together to deliver content efficiently
    * CDN reduces latency, enhances content availability, improves load handling, enables security
    * Components of CDN - Origin server, Edge server (PoP - point of presence), Request routing system (directs users to nearest PoP)
    * CDN workflow - user request > CDN routing system > cache hit (delivers the content)/cache miss (fetches content from origin)
    * Key features of CDN - caching & replication, load balancing & request routing, compression & optimization, security
