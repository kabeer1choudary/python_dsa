A) Networking & Communication - Networking is the foundation of system design
- Why networking matters
    * data exchange between components
    * enables scalbility, reliability & performance
    * communication - load balancing - security - efficiency

- How networking impacts Large scale systems
    * handles many users concurrently
    * efficient data exchange
    * reduces latency & improves resilience
    * essential for cloud & distributed systems

- Intro to IP Address
    * unique numerical labels assigned to devices in n/w
    * enables communication between different machines and services across internet
    * 2 versions - IPv4, IPv6
    * 2 categories - private, public
    * IPv4 - 32bit address - 4.3 billion
    * IPv6 - 128bit address - 340 undecillion
    * private ip - local n/w - cannot access internet directly
    * public ip - assigned by ISP - communicate over internet
    * need of private ips - IPV4 limitation - security - NAT (allow multiple devices to share single public ip)
    * role of ips - scalbility - security - load balancing - cloud networking - microservices & containers
